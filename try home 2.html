     <h3><center>Boomerang debuted in 1992 as a programming block on Cartoon Network, dedicated to classic animation from the WB library 
        (including Warner Bros. Cartoons and Hanna-Barbera productions, among many others), and was eventually spun-off into its own separate network in 2000. 
        In the late 2000s, Boomerang would engage in drift by airing more modern and contemporary programming, including reruns of shows that were either acquired or produced for Cartoon Network. 
        A 2015 relaunch (which aimed to promote Boomerang as a "second flagship" brand alongside Cartoon Network) saw Boomerang begin to produce its own original programming,
         focusing primarily on reboots of popular franchises such as Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo. In 2017, Boomerang launched its own subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service.</center></h3>
